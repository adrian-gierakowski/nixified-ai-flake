# Relicensing Contributions from AGPL to MIT

We are seeking approval from all significant contributors to re-license the contributions in this repository from the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) to the MIT License. This change is intended to enable broader adoption and compatibility with other projects.

Below is a list of contributors we are asking for approval. This list includes contributors with surviving lines in the codebase, excluding files that are already MIT licensed (e.g., in `flake-modules/packages`).

We have also excluded commits that were purely auto-formatting or style changes from the "Surviving Lines" count to better reflect authorship of logic.
